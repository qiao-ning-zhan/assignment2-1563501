### Test Case I

#### Input Test Case Answers:

1. Yes  2. No  3. Yes  4. Yes  5. Yes  6. Yes  7. Yes  8. Yes  9: Yes  10: Yes  11: No  12: Yes

#### Input Additional Information:

*My name is **Aba al Latif**, and I am a young man from **Country A**. The ethnic minority I belong to has long suffered discrimination and persecution. Because I actively participated in social movements for ethnic rights, I was arrested and detained by the government many times and was beaten and tortured in prison. The prison guard threatened me that if I continued to participate in ethnic rights activities, they would kill my entire family.*

*After being released from prison, I found that the authorities had deprived me of my right to work and education, and my life was in trouble. Racists frequently harassed me, and shops and restaurants refused to serve me. The police also repeatedly came to my house to intimidate me, forcing me to publicly express my support for the government's high-pressure policies on TV.*

*In desperation, I secretly joined an underground religious group. When we met, we often discussed how to escape the country and live in a place where faith and personal freedom are guaranteed. Later, the government launched a large-scale crackdown and arrested believers, putting them in prison. I was listed as a wanted person and had to hide during the day and go out at night.*

*With the help of my relatives and friends, I fled to neighboring **Country B**, but I still face the risk of being deported at any time because the two governments have close relations. I know that once I return to Country A, I will be sentenced to life imprisonment or even death. I have no political background; I am just an ordinary person who sticks to my beliefs and longs for freedom. Now, my only hope is to obtain refugee status and start a new life in a safe country.*

#### Additional Information:

*I am a middle-aged man from **Country C**. I have a stable job and a good income in my country. Although the overall economic situation in Country C is not as good as that in developed countries, I have not suffered any form of persecution or discrimination.*

*Recently, I learned that the welfare benefits in **Country D** are very generous, and you can live a comfortable life even if you don't have a job. So, I came up with the idea of immigrating to Country D. However, it takes many years to apply for immigration, and many conditions such as language, education, and funds must be met.*

*I learned that if you apply for refugee status, you can bypass these requirements and quickly enter Country D. Although I live well in Country C, I think the quality of life in Country D is higher and can provide better educational resources for my children.*

*In order to apply for refugee status, I made up a story: I claimed that I was persecuted for political reasons and was arrested and detained by the police many times. But in fact, I have never participated in any political activities and have never been arrested.*

*I also claimed that there were violent conflicts in my area, armed groups often harassed civilians, and the government could not provide effective protection. But the fact is that the city where I live has a good security situation and there is no armed confrontation or social unrest.*

*Finally, I quit my job, sold my property, and smuggled my family to Country D. I submitted a refugee application to the local immigration department, claiming that my life would be in danger if I returned home. But the evidence I provided was full of loopholes, and many details were inconsistent. The investigation found that my statements were basically fabricated.*

#### Additional Information:

*My name is **Lina**, and I am a journalist from **Country E**. Over the past few years, I have been reporting on government corruption and human rights abuses in my country. Due to my investigative articles exposing high-level officials, I have received numerous death threats.*

*Recently, my office was raided by government agents, and all my equipment was confiscated. I was detained for several days without charge and was subjected to harsh interrogation methods. They demanded that I reveal my sources and cease all journalistic activities.*

*After my release, I found myself under constant surveillance. Unknown individuals started following me, and I received anonymous messages threatening to harm my family if I continued my work. Local law enforcement refused to provide protection, stating that they could not interfere with government matters.*

*Fearing for my safety and that of my family, I decided to leave Country E. I cannot return home, as I am certain that I will be imprisoned or worse. I am seeking asylum to live freely and continue my work without fear of persecution.*
