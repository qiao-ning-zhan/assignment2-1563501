Additional Information:

My name is Aba al Latif, and I am a young man from Country A. The ethnic minority I belong to has long suffered discrimination and persecution. Because I actively participated in social movements for ethnic rights, I was arrested and detained by the government many times and was beaten and tortured in prison. The prison guard threatened me that if I continued to participate in ethnic rights activities, they would kill my entire family.

After being released from prison, I found that the authorities had deprived me of my right to work and education, and my life was in trouble. Racists frequently harassed me, and shops and restaurants refused to serve me. The police also repeatedly came to my house to intimidate me, forcing me to publicly express my support for the government's high-pressure policies on TV.

In desperation, I secretly joined an underground religious group. When we met, we often discussed how to escape the country and live in a place where faith and personal freedom are guaranteed. Later, the government launched a large-scale crackdown and arrested believers, putting them in prison. I was listed as a wanted person and had to hide during the day and go out at night.

With the help of my relatives and friends, I fled to neighboring Country B, but I still face the risk of being deported at any time because the two governments have close relations. I know that once I return to Country A, I will be sentenced to life imprisonment or even death. I have no political background; I am just an ordinary person who sticks to my beliefs and longs for freedom. Now, my only hope is to obtain refugee status and start a new life in a safe country.
