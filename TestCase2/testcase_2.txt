Additional Information:

I am a middle-aged man from Country C. I have a stable job and a good income in my country. Although the overall economic situation in Country C is not as good as that in developed countries, I have not suffered any form of persecution or discrimination.

Recently, I learned that the welfare benefits in Country D are very generous, and you can live a comfortable life even if you don't have a job. So, I came up with the idea of immigrating to Country D. However, it takes many years to apply for immigration, and many conditions such as language, education, and funds must be met.

I learned that if you apply for refugee status, you can bypass these requirements and quickly enter Country D. Although I live well in Country C, I think the quality of life in Country D is higher and can provide better educational resources for my children.

In order to apply for refugee status, I made up a story: I claimed that I was persecuted for political reasons and was arrested and detained by the police many times. But in fact, I have never participated in any political activities and have never been arrested.

I also claimed that there were violent conflicts in my area, armed groups often harassed civilians, and the government could not provide effective protection. But the fact is that the city where I live has a good security situation and there is no armed confrontation or social unrest.

Finally, I quit my job, sold my property, and smuggled my family to Country D. I submitted a refugee application to the local immigration department, claiming that my life would be in danger if I returned home. But the evidence I provided was full of loopholes, and many details were inconsistent. The investigation found that my statements were basically fabricated.
