Additional Information:

My name is Lina, and I am a journalist from Country E. Over the past few years, I have been reporting on government corruption and human rights abuses in my country. Due to my investigative articles exposing high-level officials, I have received numerous death threats.

Recently, my office was raided by government agents, and all my equipment was confiscated. I was detained for several days without charge and was subjected to harsh interrogation methods. They demanded that I reveal my sources and cease all journalistic activities.

After my release, I found myself under constant surveillance. Unknown individuals started following me, and I received anonymous messages threatening to harm my family if I continued my work. Local law enforcement refused to provide protection, stating that they could not interfere with government matters.

Fearing for my safety and that of my family, I decided to leave Country E. I cannot return home, as I am certain that I will be imprisoned or worse. I am seeking asylum to live freely and continue my work without fear of persecution.
